  Have you ever thought "I could do more"? Well of course you have. Half the time
  you



  actually plans to do so. But........Let's be honestI could just means, I won't,
  most of the time. Don't you want



  to change that? Don't you want to do more with this life than exist? I know we
  all tell are self



  stories about how we are living. Like, "I just went out last Tuesday" or I'm
  going Mexico in April.



  Like those few things help us stay content in the life that were not living.
  How can we break the



  cycle of I could and turn it into I can followed by I did. That's what I want
  to help you with. By



  adapting my philosophy you will not only be living your life but you will
  thrive! say it with me "I



  CAN DO MORE!"
