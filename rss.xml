            <description><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever thought "I could do more" ? Well of course you have and half the time you

actually plans to do so. But........Let's be honest I could just means, I won't, most of the time. Don't you want

to change that? Don't you want to do more with this life than exist? I know we all tell are self

stories about how we are living. Like, "I just went out last Tuesday" or I'm going Mexico in April.

Like those few things help us stay content in the life that were not living. How can we break the

cycle of I could and turn it into I can followed by I did. That's what I want to help you with. By

adapting my philosophy you will not only be living your life but you will thrive! say it with me "I

CAN DO MORE!"</p>]]></description>
